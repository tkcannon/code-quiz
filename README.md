Challenge 4

## Unfinished
- couldn't figure out scoring so a lot of things don't work
- didn't get to css
- time is not deducted for incorrect answers
- lots of other little things

## What's mostly working
- html code is done aside from any classes and id's needed for styling
- mostly runs off of event listners
- scores work but issues with updating score list

Will be resubmitting
